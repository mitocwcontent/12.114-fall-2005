description: This slide shows those distal rocks that were deposited during phase
  two, but thrust back over the passive margin during the Antler Orogeny (mountain
  building episode). It is hard to say exactly how thick the deposits were or what
  the sedimentation rate because during orogeny the rocks were highly deformed and
  imbricated like cards to that there is a great deal of repeated section. Image courtesy
  of Professor Burchfiel.
