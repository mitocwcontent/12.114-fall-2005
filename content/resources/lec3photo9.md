description: In this image we see a student contemplating the rocks further west of
  the previous image. There you find the ocean floor on which the Arc was deposited.
  The structurally lowest rocks we find below oceanic crust are tectonically layered
  dunite (the olivine-rich mantle) and peridotite (olivine-pyroxene). Image courtesy
