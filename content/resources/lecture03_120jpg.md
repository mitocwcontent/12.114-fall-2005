description: In this image we can see in the North the Sonoma orogen bounded on the
  East by the Sonoma thrust front. In the SW you can see the beginning of the arc
  intrusions above the east dipping subduction. The Permo-Triassic Front shown by
  the dashed line is the eastern extent of the compressional deformation occurring
  contemporaneously with the subduction. Courtesy of Prof. Burchfiel.
