  the distribution of Havallah and related basinal (oceanic) sediments thrust onto
  western North America, the arc rocks accreted at the end of the Paleozoic and the
  dark blue arc accretionary prism rocks west of the arc. Note the termination of
  all these tectonic elements in the southwest U.S. Courtesy of Prof. Burchfiel.'
